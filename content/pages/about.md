I originally started this blog as "Tales From Turgi" when I was living in
[Switzerland](/tag/switzerland.html) in 2010.

After moving back to Australia, I have tried to update it when ever I travel, and sometimes for other things.

It is mostly a reference for me to document and look back at things.

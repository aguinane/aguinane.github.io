Rachael and I went for a drive to [Crows Nest National Park](http://www.nprsr.qld.gov.au/parks/crows-nest/) yesterday afternoon for something to do; it's about a one hour drive north of Toowoomba. In addition to the road being lined with beautiful tall trees for most of the way, the Hottest 100 of the past 20 years was playing on the radio, making for a pretty good drive.

The camping grounds were pretty good, I think they must be fairly popular during summer. We went on the 2km walk to a lookout. It was a fairly nice walk, but not a lot of views along the way, so when we got to the end and saw the view from the lookout we were blown away. According to the signs it's called "The Valley of Diamonds", and was a much more spectacular view then we were expecting.

Heading back the other way,we went a different track and this one actually followed along the creek, so there was several water falls and cool rocky areas. It reminded me a little bit of Stoney Creek in places. I only had my phone so didn't take too many photos.

We will definitely be keen to come back in summer, after a bit of rain it would be a really cool swimming area.

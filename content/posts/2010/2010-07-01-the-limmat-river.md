[The Limmat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limmat) is the river between my apartment and work.

There's a pretty cool walking path along it which I took some photos of yesterday.

There was this cable thing spanning the river which I took a photo of, and as I took it a fox (pretty sure it was a fox anyway) appeared out of nowhere.

The wedding itself was beautiful, with the ceremony on the beach front. There was big menacing storm clouds in the background but rain held off until it was finished. We got one group photo before it started pouring rain and had to retreat to the restaurant.

The reception was without a doubt the most fun we've been to. The food was great and there was a live band that sounded incredible so everyone was up dancing. Tom got some fireworks delivered so they even had fireworks at the end of the night.

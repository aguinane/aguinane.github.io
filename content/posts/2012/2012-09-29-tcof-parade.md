On the Saturday morning there was a parade. The amount of people was insane, apparently the road up the range from Brisbane got backed up that many people came up from the city. Some of the floats were really amazing, they must have put a lot of time into them. Having had to wear the Ergon Energy Man suit in winter, I felt really sorry for the guy from Ergon, it must have been stinking hot.

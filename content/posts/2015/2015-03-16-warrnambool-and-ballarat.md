As part of our Great Ocean Road drive, we stopped over in Warrnambool the first night, and Ballarat the 2nd.

Warrnambool was really nice, and reminded us of Toowoomba, but on the sea. It had nice trees lining the streets and just seemed like a nice place for the few hours that we were there. We stayed in a cabin at a caravan park on the beach, and I went for a late night stroll at about 7:30pm and still needed my hat! Daylight savings just seems silly really, it would make more sense if they did it in the winter when the sun actually goes down early. The water was pretty cold but the beach was nice. There was also a nice park across the road with a maze.

After back tracking along the great ocean road a little bit the next day, we headed inland on our way back to Melbourne with the plan of staying the night in Ballarat. We had lunch at pub in Camperdown and there was some cool crater lakes nearby.

Ballarat was also pretty nice, although the town itself didn't seem that exciting there was a really pretty lake district. The [gardens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballarat_Botanical_Gardens) were inspired by some of the gardens in Italy, with cool marble statues throughout. They also had bronze busts of all Australia's Prime Ministers which was interesting.

They were both pretty good stop overs and I'm sure there would be more to see if we would have had more time.

On our last full day, we had a half day sail with local people with disabilities. It was very rewarding, although we went out past the heads so they could see some whales (we saw several) which caused a lot of them to get seasick.

I was part of the Youth Crew Theatre Crew, and we dressed up in the ship costumes and performed our nursery rhyme style shanties for the guests.

That night we were tasked with creating a poster for our watch to go in the ship logs. I spent ages going through the past posters throughout the journey but couldn't find Rachael, David or Katherine's photos.

We also got to write letters to our future selves, which will be posted to us 6 months later. Since I have been so slack with updating this blog, that letter should be only 3 months away now.
